      "workout": "<h2>NOTES</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Prior to starting the workout, the athlete will need to set up a barbell, with standard plates, to jump over during the burpees. This workout begins with the dumbbells resting on the floor and the athlete standing tall. After the call of “3, 2, 1 … go,” the athlete may lift the dumbbells to the shoulders and perform 1 squat. The athlete will then return the dumbbells to the floor and complete 1 bar-facing burpee. He or she will then complete 2 dumbbell squats and 2 bar-facing burpees, 3 and 3, etc. This portion of the workout is over when the athlete lands with two feet on the opposite side of the barbell after the final burpee, or when the clock reaches 12 minutes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If the athlete completes all the squats and burpees before the 12-minute cap, he or she will use the remaining time to complete Workout 18.2a, a 1-rep-max clean. </strong>The clean must be performed with a barbell, and the plates must be secured with collars. The athlete may complete as many attempts as he or she likes until the time cap is up but will only receive credit for the heaviest successful lift. Plates smaller than 1⁄2 lb. may not be used, and the minimum weight increase will be 1 pound. The athlete may receive assistance from other people to load the barbell between lifts. Each athlete may use only one barbell for 18.2 and 18.2a, and male athletes must use a 45-lb. (20-kg) barbell.</p>\n\n<p>The athlete’s score for 18.2 will be the total time it takes to complete all 110 reps or the number of reps completed at the end of 12 minutes. The athlete’s score for 18.2a will be the heaviest weight successfully cleaned, in pounds. If the athlete does not complete the squats and burpees in less than 12 minutes, he or she will not log a score for 18.2a.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Note: If an athlete chooses to scale 18.2, he or she will also have a scaled 18.2a score. An athlete who completes 18.2 as prescribed and fails to complete a lift will be ranked higher on the Leaderboard for both 18.2 <strong>and</strong> 18.2a than athletes who scale 18.2.</p>\n\n<h2>TIEBREAK</h2>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is no tiebreak for Workout 18.2. However, the scoring for Workout 18.2a does include a tiebreak. In the case where two athletes clean the same amount on 18.2a, their times on 18.2 will serve as the tiebreak, and the athlete with the faster time on 18.2 will be ranked higher on 18.2a. Ties will not be broken for athletes who did not complete a lift.</p>\n",

(5 kg) metal change plates (9 inches in diameter). When the dumbbell is at rest, the bottom of the handle cannot be more than 4 inches off the ground. Any athlete using an unconventional or unmarked dumbbell will need to confirm the weight of the dumbbell on a scale and clearly show the height of the handle with a ruler or measuring tape in his or her video submission. Kettlebells, fat bells or other non-traditional dumbbells are not allowed.  </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">† The official weight is in pounds. For your convenience, the minimum acceptable weights in kilograms are 22.5 kg (50 lb.), 15 kg (35 lb.), 10 kg (20 lb.) and 5 kg (10 lb.). Athletes lifting with kg plates will need to convert their weight to pounds prior to submitting.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For each workout, be sure the athlete has adequate space to safely complete all the movements. Clear the area of all extra equipment, people or other obstructions.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Any athlete who in any way alters the equipment or movements described in this document or shown in the workout standards video may be disqualified from the competition.</p>\n",

Before or after each lift, the athlete must state the weight and show the plates used. At the end of the workout, film the barbell being unloaded, and show the weight of the plates in order to clarify the actual heaviest load lifted. All video submissions should be uncut and unedited in order to accurately display the performance. A clock or timer, with the running workout time clearly visible, should be in the frame throughout the entire workout. Shoot the video from an angle so all exercises can be clearly seen meeting the movement standards. Videos shot with a fisheye lens or similar lens may be rejected due to the visual distortion these lenses cause.</p>\n",

After the call of “3, 2, 1 … go,” the athlete will have 14 minutes to complete 2 rounds of 100 double-unders, 20 overhead squats, 100 double-unders, 12 ring muscle-ups, 100 double-unders, 20 dumbbell snatches, 100 double-unders and 12 bar muscle-ups.</p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This workout is over when the athlete completes all the required work prior to 14 minutes or the 14-minute time cap expires. The athlete’s score is the time it takes to complete the workout or the number of repetitions completed up to the cutoff time.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">TIEBREAK</h2>\n\n<p>This workout includes a tiebreak. If all 928 reps are completed prior to the 14-minute time cap, your score will be your total time, and there will be no tiebreaker. However, if you are not able to complete the entire workout in the allotted time, a tiebreaker will be factored into your final score. During the workout, be sure to note your time at the end of every set of 100 double-unders. When you submit your score, there will be a space for your final rep count and an additional field for you to enter the elapsed time at which you completed your last full set of double-unders. In the case where two athletes have the same score (total number of reps), the athlete with the lower tiebreak time will be ranked higher.</p>\n\n<p>Note: All tiebreak times must be reported in elapsed time, not in time remaining. If you are using a countdown timer, you must convert to elapsed time before reporting your score. For this reason, it is recommended you set your clock to count up.</p>\n",

He or she also will need to measure and mark lengths on the floor for the handstand walk. This workout begins with the barbell on the floor and the athlete standing tall. After the call of “3, 2, 1 … go,” the athlete may perform 21 deadlifts, then move to the wall for the 21 handstand push-ups. He or she will then complete 15 deadlifts and 15 handstand push-ups, then 9 deadlifts and 9 handstand push-ups.</p>\n\n<p>The athlete then can move on to the heavier deadlifts to complete 21 deadlifts, a 50-ft. handstand walk, 15 deadlifts, another 50-ft. handstand walk, and finally, 9 deadlifts and a third 50-ft. handstand walk.</p>\n\n<p>The athlete’s score will be the time it takes to complete the workout or the total number of repetitions completed within the 9-minute time cap. In the handstand walk, each 5-foot section will count as 1 rep.</p>\n\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">TIEBREAK</h2>\n\n<p>This workout includes a tiebreak. If all 165 reps are completed prior to the 9-minute time cap, your score will be your total time, and there will be no tiebreaker. However, if you are not able to complete the entire workout in the allotted time, a tiebreaker will be factored into your final score. During the workout, be sure to note your time at the end of each set of deadlifts. When you submit your score, there will be a space for your final rep count and an additional field for you to enter the elapsed time at which you completed your last full set of deadlifts. In the case where two athletes have the same score (total number of reps), the athlete with the lower tiebreak time will be ranked higher.</p>\n\n<p>Note: All tiebreak times must be reported in elapsed time, not in time remaining. If you are using a countdown timer, you must convert to elapsed time before reporting your score. For this reason, it is recommended you set your clock to count up.</p>\n",

Also film the measuring process for the handstand push-up mark and the length of the floor marks for the handstand walk so all measurements can be seen clearly. All video submissions should be uncut and unedited in order to accurately display the performance. A clock or timer with the running workout time clearly visible should be in the frame throughout the entire workout. Shoot the video from an angle so all exercises can be clearly seen meeting the movement standards. Videos shot with a fisheye lens or similar lens may be rejected due to the visual distortion these lenses cause.</p>\n",

All video submissions should be uncut and unedited in order to accurately display the performance. A clock or timer with the running workout time clearly visible should be in the frame throughout the entire workout. Shoot the video from an angle so all exercises can be clearly seen meeting the movement standards. Videos shot with a fisheye lens or similar lens may be rejected due to the visual distortion these lenses cause.</p>\n",
